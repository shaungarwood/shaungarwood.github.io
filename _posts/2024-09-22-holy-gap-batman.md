Oh my god, it's been a while.

I'll be honest, I kind of forgot that I had this blob.

A few things have been happened since then. Covid, for one. The 2021 insurection. Divorce, etc.

Enough things have happened since then that the people who knew about this blog are long and gone.

This blob has always been tech related stuff. I'll keep it that way, for now. But I may go on different tangents.

I actually started this back up because I wanted to put a pgp key on my root domain.

Here's what's changed technologically:
 - obsidian.md is the note taking app I wish I knew about years ago
 - I've left a job, got laid off from the next, then found a new one I am ABSOLUTELY in love with
 - REALLy digging AI/copiliot
 - dropped python for the most part
 - I dropped all my ansible stuff for [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io)
 - I navigated to a proper pure LUA neovim setup
 - [kitty terminal](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) is my new go-to
 - [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)
 - [tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) if fucking awesome
 - got a [new laptop](https://www.mi.com/redmi-books/16-pro)
 - bought a [Supernote](https://supernote.com/pages/supernote-nomad), love it
 - using [mealie](https://mealie.io) for my family recipe server
 - my mom has a podcast
 - [SWAG](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/swag/) is great!
 - lately I've been setting up a bunch of new docker containers from [awesome-selfhosted.net](https://awesome-selfhosted.net)

 Okay well, let's see if this even will post a new one.
