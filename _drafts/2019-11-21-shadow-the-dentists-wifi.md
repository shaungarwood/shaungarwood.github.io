Therapist-hack

- super fancy hack with lots of power and password list generating
- old school detective wins in the end

I think it'd be a good story about how the low tech options are some of the best



A fan pushes smoke around the musty office. Foot steps echo in the hallway as the black silhouette stops at the glass window in the door etched with "DETECTIVE SHADOW".

"IT'S OPEN!", Shadow shouts, catching a hint of the night before still on his breath.

The door creeks open as the hallway light reveals a slender silhouette, mid-40s with shoulder-length dark hair you could curl your finger around. Shadow immediately thinks, "looks like trouble."

"Mr. Shadow?", she asks. "Are you Detective Shadow?"

"Unless they've removed my name from the door, Ms...?"

She eagerly takes a step towards his desk, "Trouble. MISS Trouble, with a capital 'T'."

Shadow raises an eyebrow and wonders if he looks like the kind of guy that can't spell. "Well, Miss Trouble. What can I do for you?"

Miss Trouble sits her clutch on his desk to nervously retrieve her vape from it. After a long pull, she answers through a thick vapor, "I need your help. Every few months, I take my brother the dentist. It's a large building with lots of offices. It's just that..." She takes another drag, "there's no cell service and all the WiFi networks are"

"secured." Shadow finishes for her. "And you want me to get you a password so you can crush some candy while your brother gets his candy crushers cleaned."

She stuffs her still smoking contraption back into her purse and withdraws a small scrap of paper. Shadow eyes it thoughtfully before taking the address from her.

Shadow rolls up to the address in his sun-faded-red '98 Ford Taurus. It's one of those buildings with a few medical offices and a million insurance agencies. Why did we need so many insurance agents? And why did they all need seperate offices?
