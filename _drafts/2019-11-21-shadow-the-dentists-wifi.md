## Thursday morning
A fan pushes smoke around the musty office. Foot steps echo in the hallway as the black silhouette stops at the glass window in the door etched with "DETECTIVE SHADOW".

"IT'S OPEN!", Shadow shouts, catching a hint of the night before still on his breath.

The door creeks open as the hallway light reveals a curvy silhouette, mid-40s with shoulder-length dark hair you could curl your finger around. Shadow immediately thinks, "looks like trouble."

[generic detective shot?]

"Mr. Shadow?", she asks. "Are you Detective Shadow?"

"Unless they've removed my name from the door, Ms...?"

She eagerly takes a step towards his desk, "Trouble. MISS Trouble, with a capital 'T'."

Shadow raises an eyebrow and wonders if he looks like the kind of guy who can't spell. "Well, Miss Trouble. What can I do for you?"

Miss Trouble sits her clutch on his desk to nervously retrieve her vape rig from it. After a long pull, she answers through a thick vapor, "I need your help." Shadow smelled dragonfruit. "Every few months, I take my brother the dentist. He has a lot of problems with his teeth and the appointments take a long time. I don't mind doing it, honestly! I love my brother, it's just that..." She takes another drag, "there's no cell service and all the WiFi networks are"

"secured." Shadow finishes for her. "And you want me to get you a password so you can crush some candy while your brother gets his candy crushers cleaned."

She stuffs her still smoking contraption back into her purse and withdraws a small scrap of paper. Shadow eyes it thoughtfully before taking the address from her.

## Saturday afternoon
Shadow rolls up to the address in his faded-red '98 Ford Taurus. The sun is packing it in for the day and it's still the nice part of October.  The address shadow had belonged to a tall brick 5-story that's probably only been around a decade or two, definitely younger than Shadow's car. It's one of those buildings with a few medical offices and a million insurance agencies.

"Why do we need so many insurance agents? And why does every single one need a seperate office?", Shadow murmers to himself.

He opens a glass door with chipped vinyl stickers announcing:
```
Synergistic Offices
732 Main St.
303-512-6629
```

The lobby was transplanted from a ski-lodge in some much nicer part of the U.S. Large brown pleather couches sat in the middle of the expansive room, circling a stone fireplace that had probably never been used.  The front desk was empty, as was most the building. No one was going to ask Shadow what he was doing here. It's the kind of building that sees a lot of strangers come and go at all hours to do business stuff. So long as he's not wearing a hoodie, the few busy bees aren't going to bother this old bear.

The green LEDs blink to life on Shadow's laptop as he chooses a stiff, ugly couch near the fireplace to wallflower into it. As usual, Shadow pulls his favorite USB from his bag. His tool of choice: Kali Linux - The O.S. for the P.I. of G.O.

"Get in, get passwords, get out, get paid.", he thought while the Kali dragon logo fills his screen.

The first swing to take is always wifite.py. A well-known python script that'll try some well-known exploits against the wifi networks. It's not a sure-fire bet, but it's completely automated and it runs pretty quick.

[wifite list of networks]

Shadow slumped in his chair.

- list wifi networks
- run wifite (easy WAP vulns), no go
- capture packets
