- "so here is my effort at being uncomfortable. posting about race on my personal blog dedicated to tech. woopiee :-)"
- this isn't a "tech" related post, but that's part of the problem. i'm white and i can seperate the two. or...i'm white and i think they're seperate, because my race has always been the "norm" so I think race isn't related to tech.
- get comfortable being uncomfortable pic! that'll be great!
- no black hackers, google only returns "black-hat hackers". try "-hat"
- no black coworkers, plenty of indian coworkers. but i don't have to worry about leaving/losing my job. when things get bad, it's much easier for me to jump ship.
- i'm an easier hire than someone who needs to be sponsored
